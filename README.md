# A-Phone-Contact-List-application-Distributed-Assignment-1-
For this assignment, I have created a Phone contact list application using java socket (TCP).  The purpose of this application is to help multiple clients collaborate to create a contact list.  This application has multiple features and services that any contact application will have on a smart device, for example, add, view, search and delete.
To execute my application you will require the following set of files. 
1.client.java
1.server.java
1.phoneList.txt
To run the java file the user can just type the following command in the terminal.
* "java server. java"
8 "java client.java"
